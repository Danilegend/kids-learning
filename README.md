Project Overview: Kids-Friendly Learning App for Grades 2-5
Objective:
Create an engaging and educational app for students in Grades 2-5 that includes interactive learning categories (Math, English, Science, General Knowledge). The app will feature a subscription model where users can access unlimited questions by purchasing through PayPal or Buy Me a Coffee. The design should be kid-friendly, with bright colors, simple navigation, and fun elements.
